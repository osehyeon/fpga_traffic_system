WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net DIV_125/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin DIV_125/cnt[8]_i_2/O, cell DIV_125/cnt[8]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PLHOLDVIO-2] Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations: A LUT DIV_125/cnt[8]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 10 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    DIV_1000_1/cnt_reg[8] {FDCE}
    DIV_1000_1/cnt_reg[4] {FDCE}
    DIV_1000_1/cnt_reg[1] {FDCE}
